Thanks to a Stanford Humanities Center Undergraduate Research Assistantship in 2011-12, Kyle Lee-Crossett has been building a database of Galileo’s letters (from Antonio Favaro’s Edizione Nazionale delle Opere di Galileo Galilei) under the supervision of Paula Findlen and with the assistance of Hannah Marcus who has been working to enhance the database with additional information on individual correspondents.\r\n\r\nOne of the interesting challenges of mapping Galileo’s networks regards the deliberate destruction of sensitive letters as a result of his trial and condemnation for his advocacy of Copernican astronomy in 1633, and the accidental loss of other letters after his death in 1642 when heirs did not carefully preserve this patrimony (they were infamously being used to wrap meat by a Florentine butcher when they were rediscovered in the eighteenth century!).\r\n","google":"","note":"Don't delete this file!
